# Copilot Instructions

## Code Comments

Minimize comment usage to only strictly necessary places:

- **Avoid comments for self-explanatory code** - Well-named functions, variables, and clear logic should speak for themselves
- **Use comments only when necessary** for:
  - Complex business logic that isn't immediately obvious
  - Non-obvious performance optimizations
  - Workarounds for bugs in external libraries
  - Regulatory or compliance requirements
  - Mathematical formulas or algorithms

Write code that is self-documenting through clear naming and structure rather than relying on comments.

## UI Text Conventions

Use **sentence case** for all UI text elements instead of Title Case. This includes:

- Button labels
- Form field labels
- Menu items
- Section headings
- Error messages
- Tooltips
- Any other user-facing text

### Examples

✅ **Correct (sentence case):**

- "Portfolio longevity"
- "Safe withdrawal rates"
- "Historical data"
- "Calculate returns"

❌ **Incorrect (Title Case):**

- "Portfolio Longevity"
- "Safe Withdrawal Rates"
- "Historical Data"
- "Calculate Returns"

### Exception

Only use title case for proper nouns and the first letter of sentences.
